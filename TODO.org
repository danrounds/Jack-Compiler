Requisite AND possible improvements for JackCC

* STARTED Build CLI front-end for compiler
*** MAYBE Options:
***** MAYBE Keep intermediary files?
***** TODO Enable muted warnings
      
* MAYBE Optimizations
*** Implement INC and DEC VM commands
*** ...combined with a specialty parse stage that converts increments and decrements into INC and DEC
***** Possibility of converting smaller additions and subtractions into a series of INCs and DECs, too, but I'd need to think about that, in light of OoOperations
*** In the VM, output `return' code only once (maybe @ the head of the code), and replace it with a jump, thereafter 
*** Do the same as the above with `add', `sub', `neg', `eq', etc. These can all be optimized for space saving (esp. since our hypothetical architecture has a completely flat memory setup
*** Write assembly code for multiplication and division
*** 

* Tests
*** Automate the error tests in the compiler stage

* Clean-ups
*** TODO Fix error output in compiler, so that an entire stack trace doesn't happen


* TODO SCAN
*** Instruction set for Hack Assembly
*** Instruction descriptions for the VM language
*** p.163, which describes the function-oriented VM commands (`call f n', 'function f k', `return'

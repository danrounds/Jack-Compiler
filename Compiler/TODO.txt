TODO & Possible additions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Automate testing of error-messages/warnings
  - Link the OS files referenced in the files being compiled to the relevant OS
    files (./OS/*). This would be easily accomplished by using the
    `varTable.listOfExtendedTypes' list and testing presence of ('Array',\
    'Keyboard', 'Math', 'Memory', 'Output', 'Screen', 'String', 'Sys')
  - Document Function Returns? Stack
  - Document IfWhile identifiers
  - Repair Jack's strange semantics for Whiles. Normal whiles take int values
    not equal zero as True. Jack's whiles take all values not equal -1 as False.
    This makes some of the more useful conditional idioms available through weak
    typing impossible to use. Python's not exactly weakly typed and even IT has
    non-zero ints (and non-empty objects) as a substitute for True.
  - Add increment/decrement
  - Add '<=', '>=', '!='
  - Add short-circuit evaluation
  - Change the file input from line to block input to decrease disk-access lag
    (see: http://effbot.org/zone/readline-performance.htm )
 OR Just input the entire file at once (using .lines, I believe. None are all that large. 
  - Make arrays more efficient at compile time, if they're integer indexed.
    -- BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF ONE DOES CONSECUTIVE ARRAY CALLS, WHILE POINTER 1
       POINTS TO THE ARRAY IN QUESTION?
  - Clean up/optimize conditionals (if / while) logic, see:
http://tecs-questions-and-answers-forum.32033.n3.nabble.com/some-improvements-td1382039.html
  - Remove null return and post return Pop in instances of void functions
  - See if you can insert deallocation instructions after the use of strings,
    to prevent memory leaks OR statically allocate strings, on program initialization
  - Add exceptions
  - Order of operations, see:
http://tecs-questions-and-answers-forum.32033.n3.nabble.com/Question-about-expression-compilation-td719567.html
  - Backend that generates "real" (e.g., x86/x64) assembly code
  - Ability to assign function pointers to variable names (requires unification
    of HACK's PROGRAM and DATA memories).
 - Conditional compilation--either using something graph-y to track function
   invocation OR, something more modest and limited to entire "modules" of the
   standard library (you'd obviously need to track dependencies /within/ the
   library, were that the approach)

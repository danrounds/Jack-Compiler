These Jack files are designed to evoke compiler errors and warnings.

They're all named in a (hopefully) explanatory way.

The subfolders are to be compiled AS folders, e.g.,
    $ jackcc.py call_to_method_does_not_exist/
    
...while the individual files in the main folder are to be compiled, one at a
time, i.e.:
    $ jackcc.py file_name.jack

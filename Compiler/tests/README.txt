Our tests are on code from either tECS examples,  or from a repo of student
code. The later is games, created by students enrolled in CSCI498: Elements of
Computing Systems, at the Colorado School of Mines, Spring 2011 semester.

I don't claim ownership of any of the relevant Jack code, but have included it,
here, because it's integral to our tests, and because few significant bodies of
Jack code otherwise exist.

If you're the author of any of the code, here, let me know. I'll gladly take it
down.

Jack projects here remain the copyrighted IP of their respective authors.

Our tests are on code from either tECS examples, or from a repo of student code.
The later is games, created by students enrolled in CSCI498: Elements of
Computing Systems, at the Colorado School of Mines, Spring 2011 semester.

I can't practically contact all the authors of the code relevant to my tests,
and I've thusly left it out. Tests might fail, as a result.
